### Usage

Dependencies:

* MATLAB, any recent version.
* [FLAM](https://github.com/klho/FLAM)

If you place your FLAM directory alongside this mfs-fds directory,
there is no adjustment to do.  Otherwise adjust the location of your FLAM
distro in the file `startup.m`.

Example:

Open MATLAB from the `mfs-fds` directory

type `startup`

type `cd 2D`

type `scat_driver`, which will run for a few seconds and produce a
2D scattering plot.
